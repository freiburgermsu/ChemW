The molecular weight (MW) can be algebraically calculated from any chemical formula that adheres to `chemical conventions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula>`_, which is exemplified in subsequent examples. 

The ``ChemMW`` object of ``ChemW`` parses a chemical formula string -- which can consist of any combination of elements and decimal stoichiometry -- and precisely calculates the MW of the chemical formula. The significant digits of the reported MW matches the lowest significant digits from the set of elements that constitute the chemical formula, where the used elemental masses are the most precise contemporary measurements of pure elements, per the `chemicals module <https://pypi.org/project/chemicals/>`_.

The ``PHREEQdb`` object of ``ChemW`` parses a `PHREEQ database <https://www.usgs.gov/software/phreeqc-version-3>`_ via the ``ChemMW`` object and exports a JSON of mineral masses for all of the described minerals in the database. This unique application of the `ChemMW` object has been applied as the pivotal means of predicting the mass of mineral scaling in the `ROSSpy module <https://pypi.org/project/ROSSpy/>`_ for reverse osmosis research.

The ``ChemW`` module is offered with the `MIT License <https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_\. Examples of the module are available in the examples directory of the `ChemW GitHub repository <https://github.com/freiburgermsu/ChemW>`_. Please submit errors or inaccuracies as `GitHub issues <https://github.com/freiburgermsu/ChemW/issues>`_ so that they may be resolved.


Installation
+++++++++++++

The following command installs ``ChemW`` in a command prompt/terminal environment::
 
 pip install chemw

__init__

The data environment, in a `Python IDE <https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/python-tutorial/python-ide>`_, is defined: 

.. code-block:: python

  import chemw
  chem_mw = chemw.ChemMW(verbose = False, printing = True)

- *verbose* & *printing* ``bool``: specifies whether troubleshooting information or MW results will be printed, respectively.

mass()

The parameterized data is fitted to the Hill equation, with the following arguments and their default values:

.. code-block:: python

 chem_mw.mass(formula)

- *formula* ``str``: parameterizes the chemical formula for which the MW is desired. The acceptable formats for the formula are quite broad, which are exemplified in the following formulae:

===================================================  ===================================================================================
 Example chemical                                      Format option
===================================================  ===================================================================================
 ``'C60_H120_O2'``                                       Underscores can arbitrarily separate content, since these are ignored by ``ChemMW``.
``'Na2.43_Cl_(OH)2_(OH)1.2_(OH)'``                      An arbitrary number of groups can be distinguished in the chemical formula, 
                                                            with ``()`` denoting the boundaries of the specified group.
  ``'Na2.43Cl(Ca(OH)2)1.2'``                             Chemical groups can be nested, with differing stoichiometric values.
 ``'Na2.43Cl:2H2O'``                                     Water molecules can be complexed, 
                                                               with a leading stoichiometric quantity of the complexation.
``'Na.96Al.96Si2.04O6:H2O'``                            Stoichiometry can be any decimal for any atom in a molecule, 
                                                                and even omit a leading zero.
``'Na2SO4:3K2SO4'``                                              Non-water entities can be complexed.
``'CaCl2:(MgCl2)2:12H2O'``                              Multiple complexations can be applied with repeated ``:`` separators. 
 ``'Ca1.019Na.136K.006Al2.18Si6.82O18:7.33H2O'``       The complexity, while remaining within the aforementioned format, is arbitrary.

The ``ChemMW`` object retains numerous components that are accessible to the user: 

- *mw* & *raw_mw* ``float``: The MW of the parameterized chemical formula with and without the proper significant digits, respectively.
- *proportions* ``dict``: The ratio of elements in the chemical formula. This loses accuracy with the grouped elements, and is being improved.
- *formula* ``str``: The original chemical formula as a string.
- *groups* ``int``: A numerical counter for the quantity of chemical groups that are 
- *group_masses* ``dict``: A dictionary for the masses of each nesting level in a molecule.

.. code-block:: python

 import chemw
 phreeq_db = chemw.PHREEQdb(output_path = None, verbose = False, printing = False)

- *output_path* ``str``: optionally specifies an path to where the processed PHREEQ database file will be exported, where `None` selects the current working directory.
- *verbose* & *printing* ``bool``: optionally specifies whether progress or results of the calculations, respectively, are printed. The former is valuable for troubleshooting while the latter is beneficial for reviewing a readout summary of the calculations.

process()

A PHREEQ database file is processed into a JSON file of the elements and minerals, with their respective formula and MW: 

.. code-block:: python

 phreeq_db.process(db_path)

- *db_path* ``str``: The path to where the ``.dat`` PHREEQ database file that will be processed.
