The molecular weight (MW) can be algebraically calculated from any chemical formula that adheres to `chemical conventions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula>`_, with the precise quantity of the significant digits that are reported by state-of-the-art experiments. The ``ChemW`` library consists of three packages -- ``ChemMW``, ``Proteins``, and ``PHREEQdb`` -- which are detailed in their respective pages. ``ChemW`` is offered with the `MIT License <https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_\. Examples of the module are available in the examples directory of the `ChemW GitHub repository <https://github.com/freiburgermsu/ChemW>`_. Please submit errors or inaccuracies as `GitHub issues <https://github.com/freiburgermsu/ChemW/issues>`_ so that they may be resolved. An effective `Python IDE <https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/python-tutorial/python-ide>`_ can be used to execute this module.

Installation
----------------

The following command installs ``ChemW`` in a command prompt/terminal environment::
